# QRotation: A Volleyball Rotation Tracker

A single-page web application to track player rotations, score, and set history during a volleyball game. The page has metadata to enable it to be used as a full screen Web Application in iOS or Android, by adding to the home screen.

This repository includes the application and a full suite of automated tests using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

## Features

-   **Roster Management**: Add and edit players with their number and role.
-   **Starting Lineup**: Assign players to starting positions (I-VI).
-   **Active Set View**: A clear 3x2 grid showing the on-court rotation.
-   **Automated Rotation**: The app correctly rotates players on a side-out point.
-   **Score Tracking**: Easily track points for both teams.
-   **Set History**: Completed sets are logged with their score and start/end times.
-   **Persistent State**: Your roster, active game, and history are saved in local storage.

## ðŸ§ª Running the Tests

The test suite covers all major user stories, from adding players to scoring, rotating, and viewing history.

    For a better debugging experience, use Playwright's UI mode.
